This project test how to combine a production build of React using Vite and serve on a real web server using Nginx and deploy to the cloud using AWS EC2
The configuration was done following this tutorial: [Docker 101 - Dockerize your React app and serve your build artifacts through Nginx](https://youtu.be/gM2cWo1DWIk?si=-xMsIGmHX34jkQo9&t=777)

Result: [Amazon Web Services EC2 instance](http://16.171.59.197:8000/)
